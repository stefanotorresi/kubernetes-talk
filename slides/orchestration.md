Automation of ***arrangement***, ***coordination*** and ***management***.

### Orchestration

It abstracts workflows and processes so that they can align with the business requirements more easily.

### Container Orchestration

- Host provisioning
- Container instantiation, linking,  
  rescheduling and scaling
- Service Discovery
- Load balancing
- Fault tolerance

Notes:
- Hosts become the basic unit of cluster capacity, adding and removing them should be effortless.
- Where and how containers are run is irrelevant, you only care that the service they provide is healthy.
- Containers are ephemeral.
- Failure is inevitable.
